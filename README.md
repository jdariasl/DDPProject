Assignment Developing Data Products Coursera's course

This project implements a basic nonparametric estimation of a probability density function (pdf) and a regression function using the well-known Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Both, pdf and regressor, were implemented using a kernel density estimator using a RBF kernel whose bandwidth can be adjusted using a slide bar. In order to evaluate the effect of the bandwidth, the pdf estimation can be compared with an histogram and the regression function can be contrasted with the real data.

The data used for the pdf estimation is randomly sampled from a mixture of two possible distributions. A mixture could have one, two or three components and their means are adjustable.

The data used for the regression function is extracted from a sinusoid function times a negative exponential.
